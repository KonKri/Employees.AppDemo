# Web Api & MVC Projects
Employees Solution includes 2 projects.

Web Api is a restful api executes queries against an azure database and returns employee results. Full CRUD operations are supported as well as a summarized view. There is a Swagger UI under /swagger URL where the user can intercat with the api without the use of other services (e.g. Postman).

MVC project implements same functionality as the web api. In addition there is a friendly UI where the user can interact with the the website.

Currently both projects are live in a free tier in azure. Endpoints can be found here:
